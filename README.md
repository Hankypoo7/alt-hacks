    I've been seeing MANY people talking about make the Add Tokens add more than 500, can you change the chance of a blook, etc.?<br>
    I wanted to clear up, there are some things you just can't change. I know it's frustrating.<br>
    There are some things you can't change without owning this site or having access to the database.<br>
    Please keep this in mind. Thank you a lot for the support.<br>
    <br>
    The three I've seen most are: change chance of something, more than 500 tokens, and unban account.
